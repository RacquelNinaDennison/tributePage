								Évariste Galois' father Nicholas Gabriel Galois and his mother
								Adelaide Marie Demante were both intelligent and well educated
								in philosophy, classical literature and religion. However there
								is no sign of any mathematical ability in any of Galois' family.
								His mother served as Galois' sole teacher until he was 12 years
								old. She taught him Greek, Latin and religion where she imparted
								her own scepticism to her son. Galois' father was an important
								man in the community and in 1815 he was elected mayor of
								Bourg-la-Reine.
							</p>
							<p>
								The starting point of the historical events which were to play a
								major role in Galois' life is surely the storming of the
								Bastille on 14 July 1789. From this point the monarchy of Louis
								16th was in major difficulties as the majority of Frenchmen
								composed their differences and united behind an attempt to
								destroy the privileged establishment of the church and the
								state. Despite attempts at compromise Louis 16th was tried after
								attempting to flee the country. Following the execution of the
								King on 21 January 1793 there followed a reign of terror with
								many political trials.
							</p>

							<p>
								By the end of 1793 there were 4595 political prisoners held in
								Paris. However France began to have better times as their
								armies, under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte, won victory
								after victory. Napoleon became first Consul in 1800 and then
								Emperor in 1804. The French armies continued a conquest of
								Europe while Napoleon's power became more and more secure. In
								1811 Napoleon was at the height of his power. By 1815 Napoleon's
								rule was over.
							</p>
							<p>
								The failed Russian campaign of 1812 was followed by defeats, the
								Allies entering Paris on 31 March 1814. Napoleon abdicated on 6
								April and Louis XVIII was installed as King by the Allies. The
								year 1815 saw the famous one hundred days. Napoleon entered
								Paris on March 20, was defeated at Waterloo on 18 June and
								abdicated for the second time on 22 June. Louis XVIII was
								reinstated as King but died in September 1824, Charles X
								becoming the new King.
